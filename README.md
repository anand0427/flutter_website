# What is this?

* Experimenting with using flutter and dart API to build a website that looks exactly like flutter.dev. My only reason to do this is to learn the dart API and flutter as quickly as possible while having a target to build which makes things easier instead of arbitrary apps to build plus getting ideas to build on the way. This readme is more like a notes feature than it is anything informative to jot down thoughts and features to implement. This will constantly evolve as I get more thoughts on this developmental process as well as pain points/ great features about Flutter.

## What to work on 

* Figure out how to use LinearGradient and BoxDecoration for getting a nice gradient color on the top bar - Done
    * It is also awesome to see Color class and general support from VSCode for Flutter and Dart. love it..
* First things first figure out nav bar and app bar. How do we get the Flutter's version of nav bar as well as a information top bar it has on the page?
    * Figure out how to get the icon when website resolution changes and the nav bar collapses
* Figure out difference between class with constructors and classes without. As well as understanding widgets and syntax of Dart for this..
* Figure out how to get the images from flutter.dev website to create the first section
